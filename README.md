## Assignment
This programming assignment has two parts.


### Part A

#### Task
You will design a simple card using only HTML/CSS. The card will look like [this example](http://i.imgur.com/aeKrEga.png) except with your own details.
You will be using [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) for this part. You will have to create a free account on Codepen and then create a new pen. Write all separate parts in the right sections.

#### Requirements
1. The webpage should mirror the layout shown in the example.
2. Elements: You should use at least one of all the following: image, link, paragraph, heading.
3. Layout: The image, heading, and link must all be horizontally centered. The biography text can be either left-aligned or horizontally centered.
4. Styling: All styling must lie within the CSS section
5. The image should have a height and width of 150px.

#### Optional
If you'd like to get some hands-on experience with Javascript before the next MP, you may attempt to recreate [this example](https://uiuc-web-programming.github.io/su17/images/mp0.gif). Although this will not be graded, understanding this early-on will make your life significantly easier for the next MP! :)


### Part B

#### Task
You will be setting up your development environment as detailed in [Part 4](#environment-setup-guide) of this documentation, and making a few small changes to the page's styling. Please begin by reading the helpful comments left in `source/index.js`.

#### Requirements
1. Get MP0 starter to run
2. Change SASS inside the `source/styles` folder so that `Hello World!` is centered
3. Add SASS rules to change the background color of the page

## Environment Setup Guide
0. Install [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/uiuc-web-programming/mp0_starter_17.git mp0`, then `cd mp0`
2. Install dependencies:
`npm install`
3. Run the dev server:
`npm run dev`
4. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/` to view your page. Note that if for some reason your port 8080 is occupied, it will default to 8081.
